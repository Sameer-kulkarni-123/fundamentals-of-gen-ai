As an AI legal research assistant, I can provide you with an overview of Section 324 of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**, which replaced the Indian Penal Code (IPC) effective from July 1, 2024.

### Section 324 of the BNS: Mischief

In the new BNS framework, **Section 324** deals with the offense of **"Mischief."** This corresponds to what was previously covered under Section 425 (definition) and Section 426 (punishment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

#### 1. Definition of Mischief
Under Section 324(1), a person commits mischief if they:
*   Act with the **intent** to cause (or knowledge that they are likely to cause) wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person.
*   Cause the **destruction of property**, or any change in the property or its situation that destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously.

**Key Elements:**
*   **Mens Rea (Guilty Intent):** There must be an intention to cause wrongful loss or damage.
*   **Actus Reus (The Act):** There must be actual destruction or a significant change in the property that reduces its utility or value.
*   **Property:** Mischief can be committed against both movable and immovable property.

#### 2. Punishment
Under Section 324(2) of the BNS, the punishment for simple mischief is:
*   **Imprisonment:** A term which may extend to **six months**; OR
*   **Fine:** Or both.

### Notable Changes from IPC
While the definition remains largely similar to the old IPC, the BNS has restructured the numbering. Under the old IPC, "Mischief" was defined in Section 425 and punished under Section 426. In the BNS, both the definition and the general punishment are consolidated under **Section 324**. 

Subsequent sections (Section 325 to Section 329 of the BNS) deal with aggravated forms of mischief, such as:
*   Mischief causing damage to the amount of one hundred rupees.
*   Mischief by killing or maiming animals.
*   Mischief by fire or explosive substances.
