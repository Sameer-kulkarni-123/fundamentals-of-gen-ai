Answer:
- **Statutory Explanation**
Under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, the scenario described involves a transition from simple theft to more aggravated forms of the offence due to the relationship of the parties and the use of a weapon.

1. **Theft by Servant:** Generally, if a clerk or servant commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of their master or employer, it is treated as a specific aggravated offence. However, when the element of a threat with a deadly weapon (like a knife) is introduced to facilitate the act, the legal classification shifts.

2. **Robbery:** According to the BNS, theft becomes "Robbery" if, while committing the theft or carrying away the stolen property, the offender voluntarily causes or attempts to cause fear of instant death, instant hurt, or instant wrongful restraint. Using a knife to threaten a victim qualifies the act as Robbery.

3. **Use of Deadly Weapon:** If a deadly weapon is used during the commission of a robbery, the law prescribes a minimum mandatory sentence, ensuring that the gravity of using a weapon is reflected in the punishment.

- **Relevant Section(s)**
1. **Section 306 of BNS:** Deals with theft by a clerk or servant of property in possession of master. It prescribes punishment of imprisonment which may extend to seven years and a fine.
2. **Section 309(1) of BNS:** Defines Robbery. 
3. **Section 309(4) of BNS:** Prescribes punishment for robbery with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and a fine.
4. **Section 311 of BNS:** Specifies that if the offender uses any deadly weapon (such as a knife) at the time of committing robbery, the imprisonment shall not be less than seven years.
